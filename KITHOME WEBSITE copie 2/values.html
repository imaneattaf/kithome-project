	     <h3>Our Values</h3>

	 
	     	
	     	 <p>Vegan: none of our items are made from animals, which means that we offer, among other things, perfectly imitated vegan leathers and natural dyes. </p>
	     	  <p>Durable: Most of our products are made from recycled materials. In addition, our products can be returned when you no longer want them so that we can give them a second life </p>
	     	  <p>Local production: Our products are manufactured in France or in our workshops in Europe, Portugal or Spain in order to limit the transport and thus our environmental impact. </p>
